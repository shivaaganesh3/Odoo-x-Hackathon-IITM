### 3. **Test the AI Feature**
1. Navigate to any project's tasks page
2. You'll see a **"🧠 Switch to AI Task Input"** button at the top
3. Click it to reveal the AI interface
4. Try these test cases:

#### **Test Cases:**
```
Test 1: "Remind John to finalize the pitch deck by Friday"
Expected: Title extracted, assignee resolved (if John exists), due date parsed

Test 2: "High priority task - Sarah needs to review the marketing budget this week"
Expected: Priority = High, assignee = Sarah, due date = end of week

Test 3: "Create user documentation for the new feature"
Expected: Simple title extraction, no assignee/date

Test 4: "Alex should complete the database migration by tomorrow - urgent"
Expected: Title, assignee, due date, priority all extracted

Test 5: "Low effort task: Update the contact list by end of month"
Expected: Effort score, title, due date parsing
```

### 4. **Verify Features Work**
